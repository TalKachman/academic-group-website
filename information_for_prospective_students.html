        <h2>Information For Prospective Students</h2>

        <p>It's so awesome you want to come and do a graduate degree with me! I would love to hear from you.
            Unfortunately I get waaaaaaay too many emails these days. <a
                href="https://byrslf.co/how-to-get-a-busy-person-to-respond-to-your-email-52e5d4d69671"
                target="_blank">This nifty little guide to writing faculty members can help you out</a>
        </p>

        <p>I can take students either through <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/interdisciplinair/radboud-ai"
                target="_blank">Radboud
                AI</a>, the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/data-science" target="_blank">data
                science</a> program, or through the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/imm" target="_blank">Chemistry
                department </a> I welcome any and all students.</p>

        <p>Albeit please consider a few things.</p>

        <p>I highly recommend looking at the groups emphasis please take a look in the research tab.
            Where do we publish what we work on, how do we approach problems and so on. In general I highly encourage an
            open atmosphere.
            So just go talk to my students. We have an open door policy
            I love hearing bright new ideas and non-obvious insights. The best way to join the group is just come and
            tell me something cool</p>
        <h3>For B.Sc students:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I don't take students in groups since I work very closely with my group. High preference if you are a
                Radboud Honours program student</li>
            <li>You should have at least Calc 1,2 and linear algebra</li>
            <li>You should have done a course on AI just so we have common grounds. Bonus points if you took my
                undergraduate deep learning course</li>
            <li>You should be very comfortable in coding. Bachelor's theses tend to be a bit more technical</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>For M.Sc students:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you checked out the things I am scientifically interested, and working on? Please do to see if
                we are aligned</li>
            <li>I usually don't take students without meeting them and talking to them at least once.</li>
            <li>You need to have a very high level of mathematical/analytical skills. Wonder what that? is look at
                some of my publications</li>
            <li>Not a must but a great bonus if you took any of my courses </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>For Ph.D students:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are interested in our work, and your mind is exploding with creative ideas, please contact us
                to explore possibilities</li>
            <li>I am always happy to talk to any and all students on anything science related.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you come from an interdisciplinary background that is a huge plus and should not discourage you from
            working with the group. I love interacting with people from all disciplines.</p>

        <p>I usually don't take students without meeting them and working with them a bit to see the fit.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of funding opportunities out there, I am more than happy to work with students to obtain
            them. Have your own funding? Fantastic! If not, please see the groups website to see if I have ways to
            fund you already</p>



        <p>Good luck with your search!!</p>
