            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The Kachman CATALYST Lab operates at the cutting edge of interdisciplinary science, coalescing ideas and
                approaches from machine learning, complexity theory, network science, and deep numerical modeling. We tackle
                cutting-edge problems in artificial intelligence and the natural sciences, bridging the gap between
                theoretical understanding and practical applications.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to advance the frontiers of AI by developing novel approaches that combine insights from
                game theory, complex systems, chemical sciences, and cognitive science. We believe that the most
                impactful breakthroughs emerge at the intersection of diverse disciplines.</p>

        <!-- Research Philosophy -->
        <section class="about-section">
            <h3>Research Philosophy</h3>
            <p>At CATALYST Lab, we embrace a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to research. Our philosophy is
                built on several core principles:</p>
            <ul class="philosophy-list">
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Innovation:</strong> We believe the most exciting discoveries happen when
                    different fields collide. Our team brings together expertise from AI, chemistry, game theory,
                    complex systems, and cognitive science.</li>
                <li><strong>Rigorous Theory Meets Practical Impact:</strong> We develop mathematically grounded methods
                    that solve real-world problems, from understanding LLM reasoning to accelerating chemical discovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Science & Reproducibility:</strong> We are committed to open-source code, transparent
                    methodology, and reproducible research. Check out our <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> for
                    publicly available code and datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Student-Centered Mentorship:</strong> We maintain an open-door policy and prioritize deep,
                    hands-on mentorship. Our students are encouraged to pursue ambitious ideas and collaborate across
                    projects.</li>
