        <h2>Information For Prospective Students</h2>

        <p>It's so awesome you want to come and do a graduate degree with me! I would love to hear from you.
            Unfortunately I get waaaaaaay too many emails these days. <a
                href="https://byrslf.co/how-to-get-a-busy-person-to-respond-to-your-email-52e5d4d69671"
                target="_blank">I highly recommend reading this nifty little guide to writing faculty members</a>
        </p>

        <p>I can take students either through <a
                href="https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/master/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">Radboud
                AI</a> or the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/data-science" target="_blank">data
                science</a> program, I welcome any and all students.</p>

        <p>Albeit please consider a few things.</p>

        <p>I highly recommend looking at the groups emphasis please take a look in the research tab. I love hearing
            bright new ideas and non-obvious insights</p>

        <h3>For M.Sc students:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you checked out the things I am scientifically interested, and working on? Please do to see if
                we are aligned</li>
            <li>I usually don't take students without meeting them and talking to them at least once.</li>
            <li>You need to have a very high level of mathematical/analytical skills. Wonder what that? is look at
                some of my publications</li>
            <li>Not a must but a great bonus if you took my course <a
                    href="https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/sow-mki75-applied-machine-learning/"
                    target="_blank">Applied Machine Learning</a></li>
            <li>I highly encourage you to talk to my other students</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Ph.D students:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are interested in our work, and your mind is exploding with creative ideas, please contact us
                to explore possibilities</li>
            <li>I am always happy to talk to any and all students on anything science related.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you come from an interdisciplinary background that is a huge plus and should not discourage you from
            working with the group. I love interacting with people from all disciplines.</p>

        <p>I usually don't take students without meeting them and working with them a bit to see the fit.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of funding opportunities out there, I am more than happy to work with students to obtain
            them. Have your own funding? Fantastic! If not, please see the groups website to see if I have ways to
            fund you already</p>

        <p>Also feel free to look at the FAQ page which I continually update.</p>

        <p>Good luck with your search!!</p>
