            <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                Our teaching approach emphasizes:
            </p>
            <ul class="philosophy-points">
                <li><strong>Theory Meets Practice:</strong> We balance mathematical rigor with hands-on implementation,
                    ensuring students understand both the "why" and the "how."</li>
                <li><strong>Research-Driven Learning:</strong> Course content reflects current research trends, exposing
                    students to cutting-edge developments in the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Engagement:</strong> We encourage questions, discussions, and collaborative problem-solving
                    to deepen understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-World Applications:</strong> Projects and examples connect course material to practical
                    challenges in industry and research.</li>
            </ul>
